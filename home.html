        <p>
            We are living in an ecosystem means humans are also a part of the ecosystem of which flora and fauna are.
            And we know that ecosystem follows a cycle of events of which we all are apart. If there is a change in this
            cycle this will affect all of us.

                Flora and fauna are a part of the ecosystem and they are interdependent on each other for their
                survival. Besides, the ecosystem becomes imbalanced if there are any adverse effects on flora and fauna,
                such as an extinction of a species.

                The flora and fauna contribute to the economy of the area through tourism. They attract many tourists.
                Caribbean, Panama, Indonesia, Amazon forests are some areas that make a lot of money every year due to
                the incredible flora and fauna found there.

            <li>deforestation</li>

        <p>Flora and fauna are getting extinct after the increase in the human activities<br>
            so we can conserve them by just stopping these activities and by reversing the process and inventing the
            better technology and by switching to them
